Sun Jan 17 2021, Batista,"Werribee, Victoria",Former Employee ,Horrible store manager,0,"Not much to say other than good crew members and free drinks
","Horrible store manager with no respect to the contract. Treated as a casual but paid at part time rate. No work life balance. Store manager constantly pressuring you to work more with little regards to your health or personal circumstances. Don’t get paid overtime when I worked more than the contracted hours. Constantly put down, manager is passive aggressive and very rude when talking to you and has no respect for the employees. Staff turn over is quite high. Hit or miss when it comes to manager and the store you work at. The pay is minimum for the amount of work and responsibilities you have. Training is mediocre, no formal training, sometime manager ask other crew members to train you.
Advice to Management
Treat employees better and actually respect the employees contract. Have a bit more empathy for employees personal circumstances. Better organisation and transition for new staff member’s training.

can easily be promoted to supervisor if you prove yourself
","poor management at store level and district level 
- store manager acts out in microaggressions and shows racist behaviour towards asians (most of the staff were asians but now is becoming a white-dominated store)
-no transparency about pay/leave, managers force you to take annual leave or find ways to not pay you

not many benefits at all other than staff discount

RUDE customers 

very busy to the point where coworkers have mental breakdowns

minimum wage not worth the stress you feel each shift
